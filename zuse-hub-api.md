## Endpoint Specifications

Following are the definitions of each API endpoint, what data they require, and what data and response statuses they return.

### Authentication/Registration

#### Registration

```
POST /api/v1/user/register
```

The above endpoint is used to register a user on Zuse Hub. It expects the following JSON structure:

```
{
  "user" : {
    "username" : "<Some user name>",
    "email" : "<Some email address>",
    "password" : "<Some password>",
    "confirm_password" : "<Confirmation password>"
  }
}
```

On success, the endpoint returns a :created status with the following json:

```
{ "token" : "<The user's access token>" }
```

This token should be saved by the client as it will be used to authenticate on all succeeding requests to the api. On error, the endpoint returns an :unprocessable_entity status with the following json:

```
{ "errors" : [ <List of full error messages>, ... ] }
```

#### Authentication

```
POST /api/v1/user/auth
```

The above endpoint is used to obtain an existing user's authentication token. It expects the following json:

```
{ "user" : {
    "username" : "<The user's name>",
    "password" : "<The user's password>"
  }
}
```

On success, the endpoint returns an :ok status with the following json:

```
{ "token" : "<The user's access token>" }
```

Again, this token should be saved by the client as it will be used to authenticate on all succeeding request to the api. On error, the endpoint returns an :unauthorized status with no json.

**All remaining endpoints require a valid token for access. If a valid token is not given, these endpoints return an :unauthroized status with no json.**

### User Specific
